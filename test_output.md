3M demonstrates strong performance and clear reporting in the Climate & Carbon category, earning a rating of 4 out of 5. The company has set ambitious, science-based targets for emissions reduction and has shown significant progress in achieving them. 

**Emissions Reduction and Targets:**
3M has committed to achieving carbon neutrality in its operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2050. [4] Their near-term goals, validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as being aligned with a 1.5Â°C trajectory, include reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 52.6% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline. [1, 6] The company has also set a target to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 42% by 2030 from a 2021 baseline. [1, 7] As of their 2024 progress report, 3M has already achieved a 59.1% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2019 and a 30.7% reduction in Scope 3 emissions since 2021, indicating they are ahead of schedule on their Scope 1 and 2 targets. [11]

**Renewable Energy:**
3M has a goal to use 100% renewable electricity by 2050. [9] They surpassed their interim goal of 50% renewable energy by 2025, having achieved 51.9% in 2022 and 56.2% across global operations in 2023. [9, 13] The company's global headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota, is fully powered by renewable electricity. [8]

**Transparency and Reporting:**
3M provides clear and detailed reporting on its climate performance. In 2023, the company reported total Scope 1 emissions of approximately 2.35 billion kg CO2e and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions of about 702 million kg CO2e. [7] Their Scope 3 emissions were approximately 6.3 billion kg CO2e. [7] For 2022, 3M's emissions intensity was 454 metric tons of CO2e per million dollars of revenue. [5] The company has been reporting its Scope 1 and 2 inventory since 2002 and has been developing its Scope 3 inventory since 2011. [14]

**Investment and Innovation:**
3M is investing approximately $1 billion over the next 20 years to accelerate its environmental goals. [4] The company is also actively involved in developing climate technologies, such as solutions for green hydrogen and carbon capture. [2, 3]

While 3M's efforts are commendable, the company's large and complex operations, with over 55,000 products, present ongoing challenges, particularly in accurately calculating and reducing the full extent of their Scope 3 emissions. [1] Continued focus on this area will be crucial for industry leadership.
